Porta
=====

Porta is an old project i have. For about 10 years i have this project i would like to finish.It is a classic RPG game.

Based in a simple question: **What if instead of fire, man discover a Portal?**

In what way this will influence the history of the mankind.

Just a few thoughts:
- Portals connect to a specific source: food, water...;
- Portals has many shapes and some are bidirectional and other uni-directional;
- Some are big enough that can be used to travel between places far away;
- Many mechanisms use this kind of portals - Example: tv with a portal to the tv building to receive broadcasts (one way portal);
- Even fire(heat) could be redirected to a machine that allow to use it in our houses;

The intent of the game is to follow the history of this different reality.

Begins in early days in the caves when man discover portal and fire (in this order :) offcourse) to a point in history somehow similar to the mediaeval epoch. 

The game will be conduct in chapters. To move on in the game i will implement a logic i call **Fuzzy Chapters**(kind of a percentage done and actions to change chapters).

This is the starting point for a big adventure i hope…
