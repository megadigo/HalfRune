Half Rune
=====

Half Rune is an old project i have. For about 10 years i have this project i would like to finish.It is a classic RPG game.

Based in a simple question: **What if instead of fire, man discover a Portal?**

In what way this will influence the history of the mankind.

Just a few thoughts:
- Portals connect to a specific source: food, water...;
- Portals has many shapes and some are bidirectional and other uni-directional;
- Some are big enough that can be used to travel between places far away;
- Many mechanisms use this kind of portals - Example: tv with a portal to the tv building to receive broadcasts (one way portal);
- Even fire(heat) could be redirected to a machine that allow to use it in our houses;
- Half Rune because half of a special stone keeps connections to the other half.

The intent of the game is to follow the history of this different reality.

Begins in early days in the caves when man discover portal and fire (in this order :) offcourse) to a point in history somehow similar to the mediaeval epoch. 

It will be a sand-box game in chapters in a open world. The game will use a logic called **Fuzzy Chapters**(kind of a percentage done and actions to change chapters) to progress.

This is the starting point for a big adventure i hopeâ€¦
